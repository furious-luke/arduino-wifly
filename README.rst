WiFly Library

Description
===========

This is a modified version of the Sparkfun WiFly Shield library
written by Chris Taylor and Philip J. Lindsay. I found the
Sparkfun library to be a little unreliable, mostly due to
a couple of bugs in the substring searching code. I've utilised
the parts I needed and rewritten sections to be more reliable,
cleaner and use later Arduino core libraries. In doing so I've
stripped out a lot of things I didn't need, such as AdHoc
network support. If there is any interest in having these features
returned I'm sure I could manage it.
